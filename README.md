# DeautherSSIDgenerator
generator has been created for a trolling action

### Usage
* connect to the deauther
* run `python3 generator.py -s <number of ssids to be added>`
* when running just `python3 generator.py` it adds 60 (max) ssids by default

#### How it works
* i've reversed engineered the web app of deauther and found `/run?cmd=add ssid....`
