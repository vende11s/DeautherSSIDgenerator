# DeautherSSIDgenerator
generator has been created for a trolling action

### Usage
* connect to the deauther
* set number of Ap's to be added by changing variable `AP` in code (its at the very top)
* run `python3 generator.py`

#### How it works
* i've reversed engineered the web app of deauther and found `/run?cmd=add ssid....`
